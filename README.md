6. Understanding the Game Base Class Structure for making new games
    All games made for Jitsi Games must be built off of the 'Game' class. The Game class provides a framework for managing game state and synchronizing it with other players using WebSocket. It includes essential methods that your new game will inherit:
    
    initializeGameState(): Sets up the initial game state for your specific game.
    saveGameState(partialState): Sends updates of the game state over WebSocket.
    mergePartialState(partialState): Receives and merges incoming game state updates from other players, keeping clients synchronized.
    handleRestartGame(): Resets the game state to its initial configuration and broadcasts the reset.
